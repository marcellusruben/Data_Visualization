# Which Vehicle to Choose in 2020?

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visualize the data regarding different types of vehicle in terms of their city Miles-per-Gallon (MPG), their CO2 emissions, and their air pollution score. Based on this visualization, you can choose which vehicle that suits you the best. The visualization was made using Tableau Desktop and the data was taken from US Department of Energy and United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA).
